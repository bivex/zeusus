+ℹ️ **Ensure CSP is effective against XSS attacks:** A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) significantly reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. [Learn how to use a CSP to prevent XSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/csp-xss/)
+
+| Use a strong HSTS policy | ℹ️ |  |
+
+ℹ️ **Use a strong HSTS policy:** Deployment of the HSTS header significantly reduces the risk of downgrading HTTP connections and eavesdropping attacks. A rollout in stages, starting with a low max-age is recommended. [Learn more about using a strong HSTS policy.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/has-hsts)

+
+| Mitigate clickjacking with XFO or CSP | ℹ️ |  |
+
+ℹ️ **Mitigate clickjacking with XFO or CSP:** The `X-Frame-Options` (XFO) header or the `frame-ancestors` directive in the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header control where a page can be embedded. These can mitigate clickjacking attacks by blocking some or all sites from embedding the page.

+# 🔍 HOT PATCHES - Быстрые оптимизации на основе анализа trace файлов
+
+## 1. 🚀 Оптимизация изображений (30 KiB экономии)
+**Проблема:** Изображения Unsplash загружаются в полном размере
+**Решение:** Использовать WebP формат и оптимизировать размеры
+
+```javascript
+// Заменить в коде:
+<img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494790108377-be9c29b29330?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=40&h=40' />
+
+// На оптимизированную версию:
+<img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494790108377-be9c29b29330?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=40&h=40&fm=webp&q=75' />
+```
+
+## 2. ⚡ Render Blocking Resources (150ms экономии)
+**Проблема:** CSS блокирует рендеринг
+**Решение:** Использовать preload или inline критический CSS
+
+## 3. 🗜️ Минификация JavaScript (128 KiB экономии)
+**Проблема:** Неиспользуемый JavaScript
+**Решение:** Code splitting и tree shaking
+
+## 4. 🔄 Network Waterfall оптимизация
+**Проблема:** Последовательные загрузки ресурсов
+**Решение:** Параллельная загрузка критических ресурсов
+
+## 5. 📱 Mobile-first оптимизация
+**Проблема:** Изображения не оптимизированы для мобильных
+**Решение:** Responsive images с srcset
+
+## 📊 Метрики улучшения:
+- **Performance Score:** 67/100 → 95/100+ (ожидаемо)
+- **LCP:** 8.5s → 1.5s (6s экономии)
+- **TTI:** 9.9s → 3.5s (6.4s экономии)
+- **Bundle size:** -158 KiB (общая экономия)
+
+## 🛠️ Быстрые патчи для применения:
+
+### Patch 1: WebP изображения
+```diff
+- <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-XXX?w=40&h=40' />
++ <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-XXX?w=40&h=40&fm=webp&q=75' />
+```
+
+### Patch 2: Preload критических ресурсов
+```html
+<link rel='preload' href='critical.css' as='style' onload='this.onload=null;this.rel="stylesheet"'>
+```
+
+### Patch 3: Code splitting
+```javascript
+// Вместо одного большого бандла
+import('./heavy-module.js').then(module => module.doSomething());
+```

++These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/). Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so [manual testing](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-review) is also encouraged.

++| Ensure CSP is effective against XSS attacks | ℹ️ |  |
++
++ℹ️ **Ensure CSP is effective against XSS attacks:** A strong Content Security Policy (CSP) significantly reduces the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. [Learn how to use a CSP to prevent XSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/csp-xss/)
++
++| Use a strong HSTS policy | ℹ️ |  |
++
++ℹ️ **Use a strong HSTS policy:** Deployment of the HSTS header significantly reduces the risk of downgrading HTTP connections and eavesdropping attacks. A rollout in stages, starting with a low max-age is recommended. [Learn more about using a strong HSTS policy.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/has-hsts)
++
++| Ensure proper origin isolation with COOP | ℹ️ |  |
++
++ℹ️ **Ensure proper origin isolation with COOP:** The Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) can be used to isolate the top-level window from other documents such as pop-ups. [Learn more about deploying the COOP header.](https://web.dev/articles/why-coop-coep#coop)
++
++| Mitigate clickjacking with XFO or CSP | ℹ️ |  |
++
++ℹ️ **Mitigate clickjacking with XFO or CSP:** The `X-Frame-Options` (XFO) header or the `frame-ancestors` directive in the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header control where a page can be embedded. These can mitigate clickjacking attacks by blocking some or all sites from embedding the page. [Learn more about mitigating clickjacking](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/clickjacking-mitigation).
++
++| Mitigate DOM-based XSS with Trusted Types | ℹ️ |  |
++
++ℹ️ **Mitigate DOM-based XSS with Trusted Types:** The `require-trusted-types-for` directive in the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header instructs user agents to control the data passed to DOM XSS sink functions. [Learn more about mitigating DOM-based XSS with Trusted Types](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/trusted-types-xss).

[Learn more about this errors in console diagnostic audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/errors-in-console/)
++
++| Missing source maps for large first-party JavaScript | ❌ |  |
++
++**Missing source maps for large first-party JavaScript:** Source maps translate minified code to the original source code. This helps developers debug in production. In addition, Lighthouse is able to provide further insights. Consider deploying source maps to take advantage of these benefits. [Learn more about source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/source-maps/).

+++These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/). Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so [manual testing](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-review) is also encouraged.

+++# Markdown Reporter для Lighthouse
+++
+++## Что добавлено
+++
+++В этот форк Lighthouse добавлена поддержка вывода отчетов в формате Markdown.
+++
+++## Использование
+++
+++### Через CLI
+++
+++```bash
+++# Установка зависимостей
+++bun install
+++
+++# Запуск с Markdown выводом
+++node cli/index.js https://example.com --output=markdown --output-path=report.md
+++
+++# Или с другими опциями
+++node cli/index.js https://example.com --output=markdown --preset=desktop --output-path=desktop-report.md
+++```
+++
+++### Доступные форматы вывода
+++
+++Теперь поддерживаются:
+++- `html` - HTML отчет (по умолчанию)
+++- `json` - JSON данные
+++- `csv` - CSV таблица аудитов
+++- `markdown` - **НОВЫЙ** структурированный Markdown отчет
+++
+++## Структура Markdown отчета
+++
+++Отчет включает:
+++
+++1. **Заголовок** с URL, датой и версией Lighthouse
+++2. **Таблица категорий** с оценками (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
+++3. **Детальные разделы** для каждой категории с:
+++   - Оценкой категории
+++   - Описанием (если есть)
+++   - Таблицей аудитов с результатами
+++
+++## Примеры использования
+++
+++```bash
+++# Базовый запуск
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown
+++
+++# Сохранение в файл
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --output-path=my-report.md
+++
+++# Только определенные категории
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --only-categories=performance,seo
+++
+++# Desktop режим
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --preset=desktop
+++```
+++
+++## Формат результатов аудитов
+++
+++- ✅ - Аудит пройден успешно (score = 1.0)
+++- ❌ - Аудит провален (score = 0.0)
+++- `XX` - Процент выполнения (0-100, для score между 0 и 1)
+++- ℹ️ - Информационный аудит (scoreDisplayMode = 'informative')
+++- `N/A` - Аудит не применим или score = null
+++
+++## Измененные файлы
+++
+++1. `cli/cli-flags.js` - Добавлен 'markdown' в список допустимых форматов вывода
+++2. `report/generator/report-generator.js` - Добавлена функция `generateReportMarkdown()` и логика обработки
+++3. `readme.md` - Обновлено описание CLI опций
+++
+++## Тестирование
+++
+++Отчет протестирован на различных сайтах и корректно отображает все категории и аудиты в читаемом Markdown формате.

++## Accessibility
++
++**Score:** 88/100
++
++These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/). Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so [manual testing](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-review) is also encouraged.

+++# Markdown Reporter для Lighthouse
+++
+++## Что добавлено
+++
+++В этот форк Lighthouse добавлена поддержка вывода отчетов в формате Markdown.
+++
+++## Использование
+++
+++### Через CLI
+++
+++```bash
+++# Установка зависимостей
+++bun install
+++
+++# Запуск с Markdown выводом
+++node cli/index.js https://example.com --output=markdown --output-path=report.md
+++
+++# Или с другими опциями
+++node cli/index.js https://example.com --output=markdown --preset=desktop --output-path=desktop-report.md
+++```
+++
+++### Доступные форматы вывода
+++
+++Теперь поддерживаются:
+++- `html` - HTML отчет (по умолчанию)
+++- `json` - JSON данные
+++- `csv` - CSV таблица аудитов
+++- `markdown` - **НОВЫЙ** структурированный Markdown отчет
+++
+++## Структура Markdown отчета
+++
+++Отчет включает:
+++
+++1. **Заголовок** с URL, датой и версией Lighthouse
+++2. **Таблица категорий** с оценками (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
+++3. **Детальные разделы** для каждой категории с:
+++   - Оценкой категории
+++   - Описанием (если есть)
+++   - Таблицей аудитов с результатами
+++
+++## Примеры использования
+++
+++```bash
+++# Базовый запуск
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown
+++
+++# Сохранение в файл
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --output-path=my-report.md
+++
+++# Только определенные категории
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --only-categories=performance,seo
+++
+++# Desktop режим
+++lighthouse https://example.com --output=markdown --preset=desktop
+++```
+++
+++## Формат результатов аудитов
+++
+++- ✅ - Аудит пройден успешно (score = 1.0)
+++- ❌ - Аудит провален (score = 0.0)
+++- `XX` - Процент выполнения (0-100, для score между 0 и 1)
+++- ℹ️ - Информационный аудит (scoreDisplayMode = 'informative')
+++- `N/A` - Аудит не применим или score = null
+++
+++## Измененные файлы
+++
+++1. `cli/cli-flags.js` - Добавлен 'markdown' в список допустимых форматов вывода
+++2. `report/generator/report-generator.js` - Добавлена функция `generateReportMarkdown()` и логика обработки
+++3. `readme.md` - Обновлено описание CLI опций
+++
+++## Тестирование
+++
+++Отчет протестирован на различных сайтах и корректно отображает все категории и аудиты в читаемом Markdown формате.

++
++These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/). Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so [manual testing](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-review) is also encouraged.
